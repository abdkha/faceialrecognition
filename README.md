# faceialrecognition

Information:
This code is meant to train the ML model on recognizing the faces of two celebrities - Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie.
Their pictures are located under the train_images folder as '1' and '2'
There are 32 pictures in each set.

The intention is to feed the python program a test_image.jpg which can be substituted of any person. 
The Door bell app will then highlight whether the person is recognizable i.e. Is it Brad or Angelina that show up to the doorstep or if its an unknown person.

Instructions:
1. Download all files and folders in a folder on your PC.
2. Run the DoorBell.py python program file.
3. A pop-up should display whether the person that is showing up to the door step is recognizable or not.
